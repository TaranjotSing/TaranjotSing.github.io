title: "The Fascinating World of Space Exploration: Insights from a Data Analytics Challenge"
summary: '"A recent data analytics challenge on the subject of space exploration provided insight into the history and current state of space missions. The data showed that Russia has conducted the most space missions and has a high success rate, Kazakhstan has played a significant role in space exploration, only 22 out of 195 countries have contributed to space missions, around 90% of space missions have been successful, and 2020 was a particularly good year for space engineers. The challenge provided an opportunity for participants to learn about the fascinating world of space exploration and practice data visualization skills."'

Have you ever wondered which countries are the most active in space exploration? Or what the success rates of space missions are? I recently had the opportunity to delve into these questions and more through a data analytics challenge organized by Maven Analytics. The subject of the challenge was space exploration, and I was able to learn some surprising and fascinating facts through my analysis. In this blog post, I will share some of my key takeaways and my data visualization of the findings.

## About the dataset
 - This dataset contains a csv table with 4,631 records, one for each space mission
 - Each record contains details on each mission's name, location, date, and status of the launch, the company responsible, and the price, status, and name of the rocket

## Analysis

One of the most striking facts that I discovered through the data analytics challenge was the dominance of Russia in space missions over the years. Russia has consistently had the most space missions, with the United States coming in a distant second. It was also interesting to see that Kazakhstan, a country not commonly associated with space exploration, made the list of top countries contributing to space missions.

Another interesting fact that I learned was that only 22 out of 195 nations contribute to space missions. This highlights the fact that space exploration is still a relatively small and exclusive field, with a select group of countries leading the way.

Perhaps most surprising of all was the high success rate of space missions, with 90% of missions being successful overall. This is a testament to the level of planning and execution that goes into space missions, and the importance of ensuring their success.

One final takeaway from the data was that 2020, a year that was otherwise a disaster for much of the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, turned out to be a great year for space engineers. Many successful space missions took place in 2020, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic.

## Conclusion

Overall, the data analytics challenge on space exploration was a fascinating and eye-opening experience. I learned a lot of interesting facts about the history and current state of space exploration, and was able to practice my data visualization skills in the process. I am grateful to Maven Analytics for organizing the challenge and giving me the opportunity to dive into this interesting subject.

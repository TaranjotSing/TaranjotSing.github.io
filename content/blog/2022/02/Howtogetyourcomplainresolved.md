Gone those days when people used to call up a company’s customer care and complain. Nowadays with the advancement in technology, people look at their smartphones or laptops to openly tell the world about the product or services of the company.

One of the most important social media platforms for complaints is twitter. A Seattle based Simply Measured Inc conducted a study showing that 99% of brands are on twitter and 30% have a dedicated Customer service and complaint handle. Companies are integrating social media in their CRM Strategy.

Recently I encountered a complaint with my current internet service provider. I called their customer care executive, got no reply, e-mailed them, again no reply. Posted my query on twitter, I got a reply within 30 minutes. I noticed a few re-tweets from the customers having the same complaint. Even the competitors started commenting and made an offer to try their service. The issue was solved in 4 hours.

So complaining on twitter can give you instant results, provided that you need to go about it the correct way. Here is how you can make a complaint effective:

## 1. Complain to right person/company

If you want to complain on twitter, the first thing is to get the correct twitter account of the company. Usually, there are a lot of fake accounts on twitter. Search for the company’s name and “Official twitter handle” in Google search, then check their most recent tweets. Just check for a blue tick to prove that a company’s account is legitimate. You can also tag the key persons of that company.

Jabbering is not an effective complaint. It’s pointless and it might tamper the relationship with the Company. Just in case if you want to feel better, you can jabber, but don’t expect anything significant from it

## 2. Composing a complaint
Tweet needs to be clear and concise. Don’t stretch tweet, it will lose its impact. Never provide your personal information on tweets like your mobile number or bank account number. It should be sent only in direct messages. Don’t use abusive language, as some companies have a policy that prevents them from responding to such tweets. Avoid being rude, state the facts, and try using a humorous tone.

## 3. Increasing the reach
Use of relevant keywords is necessary to make you tweet reach to masses unless you have a lot of followers. Hashtags keywords can be used within the tweeted message by typing “#” in front of the word. The more the reach is, the more possibility to get a response from the company.

You can also mention regulators, consumer forums, news sites, and in some cases competitors. Ask your friends and colleagues having a good number of followers to retweet your complaint.

## 4. Check with people having similar complaints
If you use relevant hashtags, the reach will increase and there will be chances of reaching to customers having the same complaints. They might retweet your complaint and you might retweet their complaint. This way the complaint will increase its reach.

Don’t repeatedly tweet your complaint on twitter. If you haven’t got a response to two of your tweets then stop. Either you haven’t made yourself clear or the company is pathetic in dealing with customer complaints about social media.

## 5. After getting a response
If the above steps are in place, usually a company representative will ask you to direct message them with more details of the complaint or ask for contact details.

Before sending the details, check if the message is from the company’s official handle (a blue tick).

## 6. Escalating the complaint
If you have a legitimate complaint and you have clearly explained your complaint, the company will be more likely to resolve the issue. But sadly if your issue doesn’t get resolved, you can always file a complaint to the Ombudsman.

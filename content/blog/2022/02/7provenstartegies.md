Twenty-five hundred years ago, a Chinese military strategist, Sun Tzu wrote a book of military strategy based on Chinese warfare and military thought. “The Art of War” remains one of the world’s most famous strategy books. Though the book is based on military warfare and thoughts a lot can be extracted from the strategies mentioned in the book. Today, a lot of Business gurus, sports coaches, politicians, democrats use the teachings from the book to deal with the conflicts of all sorts.

Once Snapchat CEO Evan Speigel felt threatened by the encroachment of Facebook into the Snapchat's market, he gave a copy of “The Art of War” to his team to have them think in terms of ruthless competition.

Everyone is fighting a conflict in their life like when you want to wake up early in the morning you conflict with your sleep and laziness. Lessons from this book can be utilized to resolve conflicts that people face in daily life and at work. Here are seven proven strategies:

### Laying Plans
According to Sun Tzu, “**All warfare is based on deception**”. When we want to attack, the enemy should believe that we are not going to attack. When we are near, the enemy should believe that we are far. In order words, never show all your cards.
When you are in business negotiation and you show all your cards, ultimately you will lose the advantage. It’s like playing chess, every move should be calculated. For Example: If you are negotiating for a higher salary with your boss and you tell him that you have received an offer from any company and you might move on if he doesn’t increase your salary. Your boss might ask you about the offer, here comes the deception strategy, “Never reveal the details of your offer on one go”. Your boss might scrap that offer and you will lose your leverage.

### Waging War
Sun Tzu says “No Country has ever benefitted from prolonged warfare”.

Don’t get into fights that you cannot afford to lose. A lot of companies do the same, they compete with each other on price point and which kills their margin and they end up making losses. This does not benefit any company. So one should know when to fight and on what grounds to fight.

### Attack by stratagem
"If you know your enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory you will also suffer a defeat. If you neither know yourself nor the enemy, you will succumb in every battle. In other words, you should have self-awareness as well as you should know about your enemy."

One can use this mindset to build better habits. Suppose you want to lose weight, In this case, sugar is your enemy. To win you should know about yourself, when and where you consume sugar and how often you consume sugar. You should also know about your enemy, Which food items have high sugar content and how to avoid them. If you incorporate both in your strategy you will win against obesity.

### Tactical Dispositions
Sun Tzu says **“The victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat, first battles and afterward looks for the victory.”** It means that you first have to make yourself strong, then look for your opponent to make a mistake and then attack.

In any business situation if you want to compete with another company don’t attack immediately. First, make sure that you are strong enough and then wait for the competitor to make a mistake this will give you an opportunity to attack. For this, you have to be patient and smart.

### Strong Points and Weak Points

**“Avoid what is strong and attack what is weak”**. It is very obvious. Suppose you are running a business. Your competitor can afford to keep fewer prices or offer discounts. Then you don’t need to compete on the price point instead compete on customer service, quality. Don’t hit your competition on points where he is strong, hit them at the points where he is weak.

### Use of Spies

Management of spies is important. For a business to be successful, we should also know our enemy from inside. Just to have foreknowledge about competition. In order to achieve this, you can be friends with the employees of your competitor or even try the products of the competition so that you can know the pros and cons of that product.

### Terrain
**“If you know your enemy and yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know the terrain, you may make your victory complete”**. If you are entering a new market, just knowing about yourself and your competition is not enough. You should also know about the market, the customer behavior of that market. A detailed analysis needs to be done in order to know the environment.

One thing is told consistently in this book that **“Knowledge is Power”**. It doesn’t matter if you know all the strategies and don’t have knowledge. To win knowledge is mandatory.
